# This is a single example for lots of ideas. Actual files in
# /etc/sudoers.d should be as minimalist as possible. Use whole files

# Privilege Sets
# Format:
# USERREF	HOSTREF=(TARGETUSERREF) CMDREF

# These entries allow members of the TIMEKEEPSERS alias or members of
# the AD group called `ad_timekeepers` to run the set of commands in
# NTPCMD as the user TIMEDAEMON. Notice that using the AD group means
# the TIMEKEEPERS alias above doesn't need to be edited every time
# someone gains or loses the privilege set.
