# Badge Assembly Class/Object File

This PHP script would create a page of personel badges as an object,
allow for manipulating the individual badges in that object, and
writing out the page as a PDF file for printing. Then, the badges would
be cut apart and laminated.

I used this class file for years as the Plans Section Chief for the
Emergency Services Department at Burning Man. I was writing a wrapper
to this class file that would print individual badges onto a badge
printer when I left Burning Man in 2013. (If memory serves, I crafted
something that pulled the `$members` array data out of a MySQL
database. But, that code has been lost.)
