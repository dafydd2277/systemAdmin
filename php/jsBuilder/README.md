# JavaScript Code Builder

This was a PHP experiment that I wrote years ago. `jsBuilder.php`
fills out `jsTemplate.txt` and returns the complete JavaScript
`jsBuilderResult.txt`. With this method, a functional JS script could
be assembled to validate any form on the browser side and force
character limitations or issue alerts for form fields that didn't pass
validation.

Of course, this would be no substitute for performing the same
validation on the server side once the form, or individual fields,
were submitted.
